# Assistant with dynamically created MCP connections

This sample demonstrates how to create MCP clients dynamically based on what the user enters in the UI.

You can import both public and secured MCP servers. Navigate to the `dynamic-mcp-clients-assistant` folder to get started.

If you would like, you can launch a Quarkus MCP Server with public and secured endpoints in the `dynamic-mcp-clients-server` folder.
