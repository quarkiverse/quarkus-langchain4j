= Easy RAG: the easiest way to get started with Retrieval Augmented Generation

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

The Quarkus LangChain4j project provides a separate extension named
`quarkus-langchain4j-easy-rag` which provides an extremely easy way to get a
RAG pipeline up and running. All that is needed to ingest documents into an
embedding store is a single configuration property,
`quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path`, which denotes a path in the local
filesystem where your documents are stored. On startup, Quarkus will
automatically scan all files in the directory and ingest them into an
embedding store.

Apache Tika, a library for parsing various file formats, is used under the
hood, so your documents can be in any of its supported formats (plain text,
PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc), including images with text, which will be parsed
using OCR (OCR requires to have the Tesseract library installed in your
system - see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TIKA/TikaOCR).

You also don't even need to add a "real" embedding store - the
`quarkus-langchain4j-easy-rag` extension will automatically register a
simple in-memory store for you if no other store is detected. You also don't
have to provide an implementation of `RetrievalAugmentor`, a basic default
instance will be generated for you and wired to the in-memory store.

WARNING: An in-memory embedding store is OK for very simple use cases and
getting started quickly, but is extremely limited in terms of scalability,
and the data in it is not stored persistently. When using Easy RAG, it is
still possible to use a persistent embedding store, such as Redis, by adding
the relevant extension (like `quarkus-langchain4j-redis`) to your
application.

To see this extension in action, use the project `samples/chatbot-easy-rag`
in the `quarkus-langchain4j` repository. Simply clone the repository,
compile it with `mvn clean install -DskipTests`, navigate to
`samples/chatbot-easy-rag`, and then start the project using `mvn
quarkus:dev`. When the application starts, navigate to `localhost:8080` and
ask any questions that the bot can answer (look into the files in
`samples/chatbot-easy-rag/src/main/resources/documents` to see what
documents the bot has ingested). For example, ask:

----
What are the benefits of a standard savings account?
----

NOTE: This application contains an HTML+JavaScript based UI. But with
Quarkus dev mode, it is possible to try out RAG even without having to
write a frontend. If the application is in dev mode, simply open the Dev UI
(http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui) and click the 'Chat' button inside the
LangChain4j card. A built-in UI for chatting will appear, and it will make
use of the RAG pipeline created by the Easy RAG extension. More information
about Dev UI features is on the xref:dev-ui.adoc[Dev UI] page.

To control the parameters of the document splitter that ingests documents
at startup, use the following properties:

- `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.max-segment-size`: The maximum
  length of a single document, in tokens. Default is 300.
- `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.max-overlap-size`: The overlap
  between adjacent documents. Default is 30.

To control the number of retrieved documents, use
`quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.max-results`. The default is 5.

To control the path matcher denoting which files to ingest, use
`quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path-matcher`. The default is `glob:**`,
meaning all files recursively.

For finer-grained control of the Apache Tika parsers (for example, to turn
off OCR capabilities), you can use a regular XML config file recognized by
Tika (see https://tika.apache.org/2.9.2/configuring.html[Tika
documentation]), and specify `-Dtika.config` to point at the file.
