= Easy RAG: the easiest way to get started with Retrieval Augmented Generation

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

The Quarkus LangChain4j project provides a separate extension named
`quarkus-langchain4j-easy-rag` which provides an extremely easy way to get a
RAG pipeline up and running. After adding this extension to your
application, all that is needed to ingest documents into an embedding store
is to add a dependency that provides an embedding model, and provide a
single configuration property, `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path`, which
denotes a path in the local filesystem where your documents are stored. On
startup, Quarkus will automatically scan all files in the directory and
ingest them into an in-memory embedding store.

Apache Tika, a library for parsing various file formats, is used under the
hood, so your documents can be in any of its supported formats (plain text,
PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.), including images with text, which will be parsed
using OCR (OCR requires to have the Tesseract library installed in your
system - see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TIKA/TikaOCR).

You also don't even need to add a persistent embedding store - the
`quarkus-langchain4j-easy-rag` extension will automatically register a
simple in-memory store for you if no other store is detected. You also don't
have to provide an implementation of `RetrievalAugmentor`, a basic default
instance will be generated for you and wired to the in-memory store.

WARNING: An in-memory embedding store is OK for very simple use cases and
getting started quickly, but is extremely limited in terms of scalability,
and the data in it is not stored persistently. When using Easy RAG, it is
still possible to use a persistent embedding store, such as Redis, by adding
the relevant extension (like `quarkus-langchain4j-redis`) to your
application.

You have to add an extension that provides an embedding model. For that, you
can choose from the plethora of extensions like
`quarkus-langchain4j-openai`, `quarkus-langchain4j-ollama`, or import an
xref:in-process-embedding.adoc[in-process embedding model] - these have the
advantage of not having to send data over the wire.

NOTE: If you add two or more artifacts that provide embedding models,
Quarkus will ask you to choose one of them using the
`quarkus.langchain4j.embedding-model.provider` property.

== Reusing embeddings

You might find that when doing local development that computing embeddings takes some time. This pain can often be felt in dev mode when it may take several minutes between restarts.

That's where reusable ingestions come in! If you don't configure a persistent embedding store and set

[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.reuse-embeddings.enabled=true
----

then the `easy-rag` extension will detect the local embeddings. If they exist then they are loaded into the embedding store. If they don't exist, they are computed as normal and then written out to the file `easy-rag-embeddings.json` in the current directory.

NOTE: You can customize the embeddings file by setting the `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.reuse-embeddings.file` property.

See this diagram which describes the flow:

== Getting started with a ready-to-use example

To see Easy RAG in action, use the project `samples/chatbot-easy-rag` in the
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-langchain4j[quarkus-langchain4j
repository]. Simply clone the repository, navigate to
`samples/chatbot-easy-rag`, declare the `QUARKUS_LANGCHAIN4J_OPENAI_API_KEY`
environment variable containing your OpenAI API key and then start the
project using `mvn quarkus:dev`. When the application starts, navigate to
`localhost:8080` and ask any questions that the bot can answer (look into
the files in `samples/chatbot-easy-rag/src/main/resources/documents` to see
what documents the bot has ingested). For example, ask:

----
What are the benefits of a standard savings account?
----

NOTE: This application contains an HTML+JavaScript based UI. But with
Quarkus dev mode, it is possible to try out RAG even without having to
write a frontend. If the application is in dev mode, simply open the Dev UI
(http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui) and click the 'Chat' button inside the
LangChain4j card. A built-in UI for chatting will appear, and it will make
use of the RAG pipeline created by the Easy RAG extension. More information
about Dev UI features is on the xref:dev-ui.adoc[Dev UI] page.

To control the parameters of the document splitter that ingests documents
at startup, use the following properties:

- `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.max-segment-size`: The maximum
  length of a single document, in tokens. Default is 300.
- `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.max-overlap-size`: The overlap
  between adjacent documents. Default is 30.

To control the number of retrieved documents, use
`quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.max-results`. The default is 5.

To control the path matcher denoting which files to ingest, use
`quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path-matcher`. The default is `glob:**`,
meaning all files recursively.

For finer-grained control of the Apache Tika parsers (for example, to turn
off OCR capabilities), you can use a regular XML config file recognized by
Tika (see https://tika.apache.org/2.9.2/configuring.html[Tika
documentation]), and specify `-Dtika.config` to point at the file.

== Configuration

Several configuration properties are available:
