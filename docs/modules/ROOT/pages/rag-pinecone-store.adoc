= Pinecone Vector Store

Pinecone is a fully managed, scalable vector database optimized for similarity search.
With Quarkus LangChain4j, you can use Pinecone as a vector store to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

This guide explains how to configure and use Pinecone as a document store for embedded vectors.

== Prerequisites

To use Pinecone, you need:

* A Pinecone account and an active API key
* A Pinecone index with a configured dimension matching your embedding model
* The Pinecone index must support the same vector similarity metric as your use case (e.g., cosine)

== Dependency

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

include::./includes/quarkus-langchain4j-maven-dependencies.adoc[provider-artifact=quarkus-langchain4j-pinecone]

== Configuration

You must configure your Pinecone API key, environment, index name, and embedding dimension in `application.properties`.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.pinecone.api-key=your-api-key
quarkus.langchain4j.pinecone.environment=us-west1-gcp
quarkus.langchain4j.pinecone.project-id=your-project-id
quarkus.langchain4j.pinecone.index-name=my-index
quarkus.langchain4j.pinecone.dimension=1536
----

See below for full configuration options:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-pinecone.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

== Embedding Dimension

Make sure the configured dimension matches the embedding model you're using:

* OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` → 1536
* `AllMiniLmL6V2QuantizedEmbeddingModel` → 384

If the dimension mismatches the index configuration, insertion and querying will fail.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your Pinecone index must be created with the correct vector dimension ahead of time* Quarkus will not automatically provision or reconfigure indexes.
====

== Usage Example

Once installed and configured, you can use the Pinecone vector store to ingest and retrieve embedded documents:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithPinecone.java[]
----

This example demonstrates how to store text segments along with embeddings and metadata in Pinecone.

== How It Works

The Pinecone store integration works by:

* Converting input text into embedding vectors using your configured `EmbeddingModel`
* Storing each vector with associated metadata and a unique ID
* Executing similarity queries using Pinecone’s top-k vector search
* Returning the most relevant matches for inclusion in a RAG prompt

Internally, the extension uses Pinecone’s REST API (via the official Java SDK) to:

* Upsert vectors (`/vectors/upsert`)
* Query vectors (`/query`)
* Fetch metadata for matched entries

== Summary

To use Pinecone as a vector store for RAG with Quarkus LangChain4j:

* Create a Pinecone index with the correct vector dimension
* Add the `quarkus-langchain4j-pinecone` dependency
* Configure API credentials, environment, and index parameters
* Use the `PineconeEmbeddingStore` to ingest and retrieve content
