= Chroma Document Store

Chroma is a lightweight, open-source vector database designed for embedding-based search.
It can be used as a document store in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with Quarkus LangChain4j.

This guide explains how to configure and use Chroma as an embedding-aware document store.

== Dependency

To enable Chroma integration in your Quarkus project, add the following Maven dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-langchain4j-chroma</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Dev Services Support

The Chroma extension provides Dev Services support: when running in development or test mode, a containerized Chroma instance will be started automatically, no manual configuration required.

If you wish to customize the container behavior, such as the image or exposed ports, you can use standard `quarkus.devservices.*` properties.
For example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.chroma.devservices.image-name=ghcr.io/chroma-core/chroma:latest
----

Refer to the configuration section below for more options.

== Usage Example

Once the extension is installed and the dev service (or external Chroma instance) is available, you can use the Chroma document store as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithChroma.java[]
----

This example demonstrates how to ingest content into Chroma, where it will be indexed and stored with its vector embedding.

== Configuration

The Chroma extension can be configured using the following options:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-chroma.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

== Notes

* Chroma supports metadata, but filtering capabilities may depend on the current Chroma version and API behavior.
* The embedding vector size must match the dimension of your embedding model.
* The Chroma backend is typically local (SQLite-based), but distributed setups may be available depending on your deployment.

== Summary

To use Chroma as a vector store for RAG with Quarkus LangChain4j:

* Add the Chroma extension to your project.
* Ensure your embedding model's vector dimension matches your configuration.
* Use Dev Services for a containerized Chroma instance in dev/test mode.
* Use the `ChromaEmbeddingStore` to ingest and retrieve vectorized documents.
