= Redis Document Store

Redis can serve as an efficient document store for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using Quarkus LangChain4j.
This guide explains how to configure and use Redis as a vector-capable document store.

[NOTE]
====
You can implement a custom `ContentRetriever` for Redis as well.
This page focuses on the integration of Redis as a vector store, allowing you to store and retrieve documents enriched with vector embeddings for RAG scenarios.
====

== Prerequisites

To use Redis as a document store, the following conditions must be met:

* Redis must support both the **RedisJSON** and **RedisSearch** modules.
* We recommend using **Redis Stack**, which bundles these modules.
* Vector embeddings must have a fixed dimension matching your embedding model.

[IMPORTANT]
.Redis Stack Required
====
Redis support requires the RedisJSON and RedisSearch modules.
These are not part of standard Redis deployments.
Use the `redis-stack:latest` image or an equivalent setup that includes the necessary modules.
====

When using Dev Services, the `quarkus-langchain4j-redis` extension automatically uses the `redis-stack:latest` container image.
You can override this by setting the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.redis.devservices.image-name=your/custom/image
----

== Dependency

To enable Redis integration in your Quarkus project, add the following Maven dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-langchain4j-redis</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

This extension builds on top of the https://quarkus.io/guides/redis[Quarkus Redis client].
Ensure the default Redis data source is properly configured* For more details, refer to:

- https://quarkus.io/guides/redis[Redis Quickstart Guide]
- https://quarkus.io/guides/redis-reference[Redis Reference Documentation]

== Embedding Dimension

You must configure the dimension of the embedding vectors to match your model by setting:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.redis.dimension=384
----

Typical values include:

* `AllMiniLmL6V2QuantizedEmbeddingModel` → 384
* OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` → 1536

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the embedding dimension is missing or mismatched, ingestion and retrieval will fail or produce inaccurate results.

If you switch to a different embedding model, ensure the `dimension` value is updated accordingly.
====

== Usage Example

Once the extension is installed and configured, you can use the Redis document store as shown below:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithRedis.java[]
----

== Configuration

By default, the extension uses the default Redis data source and standard configuration values.
You can customize its behavior using the following options:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-redis.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

== How It Works

Each ingested document is stored in Redis as a JSON object that includes:

* The original text
* Metadata
* A vector embedding

The extension automatically indexes documents using RedisSearch, enabling fast similarity queries.
Retrieval operations use `FT.SEARCH` combined with KNN (k-nearest neighbor) queries to find the most relevant results.

== Metadata Filtering

The Redis document store supports limited metadata filtering with the following constraints:

* Only **numeric fields** can be used in filters.
* Only **AND** conditions are supported (no `OR`, `NOT`, or nested logic).
* You must explicitly declare the numeric fields that can be used for filtering:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.redis.numeric-metadata-fields=year,pageCount
----

You may also declare **textual fields**, which will be returned with search results but cannot be used for filtering:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.redis.textual-metadata-fields=language,author
----

[NOTE]
====
Textual metadata fields are returned in query results but are not currently usable as filter criteria.
====

== Summary

To use Redis as a vector store with Quarkus LangChain4j:

* Ensure Redis Stack (or Redis with RedisJSON and RedisSearch) is available
* Add the required extension and configure the Redis client
* Set the embedding dimension to match your embedding model
* Declare metadata fields to support filtering and enrichment
* Use `RedisEmbeddingStore` for ingestion and retrieval
