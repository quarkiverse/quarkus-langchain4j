= Model Context Protocol

LangChain4j supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to communicate with
MCP compliant servers that can provide and execute tools. General
information about the protocol can be found at the
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/[MCP website]. More detailed information can
also be found in the https://docs.langchain4j.dev/tutorials/mcp[LangChain4j
documentation], this documentation focuses on features that Quarkus provides
on top of the upstream module. For an example project that uses MCP, see
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-langchain4j/tree/main/samples/mcp-tools[mcp-tools]
project in the `quarkus-langchain4j` repository.

NOTE: There is also a Quarkus extension for developing MCP servers. See
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-server[GitHub repo] and
https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-mcp-server/dev/index.html[documentation].

== Declaratively generating a tool provider backed by MCP

Quarkus offers a way to generate a tool provider backed by one or more MCP
servers declaratively from the configuration model. When using this, all AI
services that don't explicitly declare to use a different tool provider will
then be wired up to it, without having to write any MCP-specific code in the
AI service. Example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.mcp.github.transport-type=stdio
quarkus.langchain4j.mcp.github.command=npm,exec,@modelcontextprotocol/server-github
quarkus.langchain4j.mcp.github.environment.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
----

With this configuration, Quarkus will generate a tool provider that talks to the `server-github`
MCP server. The server will be started automatically as a subprocess using the provided command
(`npm exec @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`). The `environment.*` properties define
environment variables that will be passed to the subprocess. With this configuration, any
AI Service that does not declare a specific tool provider will be wired to this one.

== Logging

For declaratively defined MCP clients, Quarkus overrides the default handler
for received MCP logging messages with a handler that, apart from simply
logging them with an application logger, produces a CDI event for each
message. So if you need your application to react to MCP logging messages,
you can observe these events in a CDI bean like this:

[source,java]
----
public void onLogMessage(@Observes @McpClientName("KEY") McpLogMessage logMessage) {
    // ...
}
----

The `McpLogMessage` class's fully qualified name is
`dev.langchain4j.mcp.client.logging.McpLogMessage` and it contains the log
message as a `JsonNode`, the log level and the logger name.

The optional `@McpClientName` qualifier is used to specify the name of the
MCP client that the log message is related to. This is useful when you have
multiple MCP clients in your application and you want to react to log
messages from a specific one.
