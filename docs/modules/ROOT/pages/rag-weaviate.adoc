= Weaviate Embedding Store

Weaviate is a scalable vector-native database designed for semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases.
This guide explains how to use Weaviate as an embedding store in Quarkus LangChain4j.

== Overview

Weaviate stores text segments and their corresponding embeddings and exposes powerful similarity search capabilities.
With Quarkus LangChain4j, you can ingest documents and perform vector-based retrieval with minimal setup.

== Dependency

To enable Weaviate support in your Quarkus application, add the following dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-langchain4j-weaviate</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Dev Services Support

When running in development or test mode, the extension will automatically start a containerized Weaviate instance using Dev Services, unless a `host` is explicitly configured.

You can disable the Dev Service or connect to an existing Weaviate instance by configuring:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.weaviate.host=localhost
quarkus.langchain4j.weaviate.port=8080
----

[NOTE]
====
When using a remote Weaviate instance, Dev Services are automatically disabled.
====

== Usage Example

Once configured, you can use the Weaviate embedding store like any other vector store:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithWeaviate.java[]
----

This allows you to ingest documents and perform similarity queries with any supported embedding model.

== Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the extension using the following configuration options:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-weaviate.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

== How It Works

* Ingested content is stored as `objects` in a Weaviate class with associated vector embeddings.
* The extension uses `nearVector` queries to perform KNN-based similarity search.
* Metadata is stored as custom object properties and returned in search results.

== Summary

To use Weaviate with Quarkus LangChain4j:

1. Add the `quarkus-langchain4j-weaviate` extension
2. Configure a local or remote Weaviate instance
3. Ingest and retrieve documents using the `WeaviateEmbeddingStore`
