= Neo4j Embedding Store

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]
include::./includes/customization.adoc[]

Neo4j is a graph database that also supports vector search starting from version 5.x.
With Quarkus LangChain4j, you can use Neo4j as a vector-capable document store for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Neo4j 5.11 or later is required for native vector similarity search via the `KNN` clause.
Ensure your Neo4j deployment supports this feature.
====

== Dependency

To enable Neo4j vector store support, add the following dependency:

include::./includes/quarkus-langchain4j-maven-dependencies.adoc[provider-artifact=quarkus-langchain4j-neo4j]

This extension depends on the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-neo4j[`quarkus-neo4j`] extension for Neo4j driver configuration, Dev Services support, and reactive client integration.

[NOTE]
====
All standard `quarkus-neo4j` configuration properties are available. For full documentation, refer to:
https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-neo4j/dev/index.html
====

== Prerequisites

Ensure your Neo4j instance:

* Is running version 5.11 or newer
* Has the `gds` (Graph Data Science) plugin installed (if needed for advanced vector operations)
* Has schema configured for vector indexing (see below)

== Embedding Dimension

You must define the dimensionality of your embedding vectors:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.neo4j.dimension=384
----

Typical dimensions:

* `AllMiniLmL6V2QuantizedEmbeddingModel` → 384
* OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` → 1536

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the embedding dimension is missing or mismatched, ingestion and retrieval will fail or produce inaccurate results.

If you switch to a different embedding model, ensure the `dimension` value is updated accordingly.
====

== Usage Example

Once installed and configured, you can use Neo4j to ingest and retrieve documents based on vector similarity:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithNeo4J.java[]
----

== Configuration

You can configure the Neo4j connection and vector store behavior using these properties:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-neo4j.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

Common settings include:

* `quarkus.langchain4j.neo4j.dimension` – Required; dimension of your embeddings
* `quarkus.neo4j.uri`, `quarkus.neo4j.authentication.*` – Standard Neo4j driver settings

== How It Works

Internally, the extension maps each document into a Neo4j node with:

* A `text` property (raw content)
* A `vector` property (embedding)
* Optional metadata stored as node properties

Documents are stored in a custom label (`:Document`) and indexed using Neo4j’s vector search capabilities.

Vector queries are executed using the `KNN` clause:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (d:Document)
RETURN d.text, gds.similarity.cosine(d.vector, $queryVector) AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5
----

== Schema Setup

The vector field is stored as a list of floats and must be indexed for similarity search:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE VECTOR INDEX langchain_vector_index FOR (d:Document)
ON (d.vector) OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
  `vector.dimensions`: 384,
  `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}};
----

The extension will attempt to create this index automatically if it does not exist.

== Metadata Filtering

Neo4j supports flexible filtering based on node properties. You can attach metadata as key-value pairs to each node and query with Cypher expressions.

Example: Restrict to documents from a given author and year:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (d:Document)
WHERE d.author = 'Alice' AND d.year = 2023
RETURN ...
----

[NOTE]
Metadata filtering is fully supported using standard Cypher conditions alongside vector similarity.

== Summary

To use Neo4j as a vector store for RAG with Quarkus LangChain4j:

1. Ensure Neo4j 5.11+ with vector indexing is available
2. Add the `quarkus-langchain4j-neo4j` dependency
3. Set the vector `dimension` and Neo4j connection parameters
4. Use the `Neo4jEmbeddingStore` to ingest and retrieve documents
5. Leverage Cypher filters and indexing for fine-grained control
