= Implementing a Summarization Service

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]
include::./includes/customization.adoc[]

This guide shows you how to implement a simple text summarization service using Quarkus LangChain4j and run it as a standalone CLI application.
The service reads a plain text file (such as an article or report), sends the content to a Large Language Model, and receives a structured Markdown summary in return.

[#setup]
== Project Setup

Make sure you’ve added your preferred LLM provider to your `pom.xml`. For example, to use OpenAI:

include::./includes/quarkus-langchain4j-maven-dependencies.adoc[provider-artifact=quarkus-langchain4j-openai]

Then configure your API key in `application.properties`:

[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.api-key=sk-...
----

[NOTE]
.Other providers supported
====
See xref:models.adoc[Models Serving] for other available LLM integrations.
====

[#ai-service]
== Defining the Summarization Service

The summarization logic is defined using a declarative AI service, a Java interface annotated with system and user messages.

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService
@ApplicationScoped
@SystemMessage("""
You are an expert content summarizer. You take content in and output a Markdown formatted summary using the format below.

# OUTPUT SECTIONS
- Combine all of your understanding of the content into a single, 20-word sentence in a section called ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:.
- Output the 10 most important points of the content as a list with no more than 15 words per point into a section called MAIN POINTS:
- Output a list of the 5 best takeaways from the content in a section called TAKEAWAYS:.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
- Create the output using the formatting above.
- You only output human readable Markdown.
- Output numbered lists, not bullets.
- Do not output warnings or notes—just the requested sections.
- Do not repeat items in the output sections.
- Do not start items with the same opening words.
""")
public interface SummarizationService {

    @UserMessage("Input: {input}")
    String summarize(String input);
}
----

This interface defines a system message to guide the model's behavior and a method for passing the input content.

Let's look at the `summarize` method.
The `@UserMessage` annotation specifies how the input should be formatted when sent to the model.
The `\{input}` placeholder will be replaced with the actual content passed to the method.

[#main-app]
== Writing the Main Application

The main class reads a text file and uses the summarization service to process it.

[source,java]
----
@QuarkusMain
public class Main implements QuarkusApplication {

    @Inject
    SummarizationService ai;

    @Override
    public int run(String... args) throws IOException {
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.err.println("Please provide the path to the text file as an argument.");
            return 1;
        }
        var article = Files.readString(new File(args[0]).toPath());
        System.out.println(ai.summarize(article));
        return 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Quarkus.run(Main.class, args);
    }
}
----

This class is annotated with `@QuarkusMain`, making it the application's entry point.
It loads a text file from disk (the path is given as parameter) and passes the content to the AI service for summarization.

[#run]
== Running the Application

To run the application in dev mode:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args="path/to/your/article.txt"
----

Once running, the console should print a structured summary in Markdown format, including:

- A one-sentence summary
- A list of main points
- A list of key takeaways

[NOTE]
.The output format is defined in the system message
====
The model is instructed to format the result in Markdown using numbered sections.
This makes the output easy to parse, store, or render in downstream applications.
