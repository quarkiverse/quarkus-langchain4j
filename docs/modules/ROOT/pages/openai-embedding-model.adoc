= OpenAI Embedding Models

OpenAI is a leading AI research organization known for its groundbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4.

In addition to chat capabilities, OpenAI provides https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#embedding-models[embedding models], which are essential for building semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

== Prerequisites

include::./openai-chat-model.adoc[tags=openai-prerequisites]

=== OpenAI Quarkus Extension

To use OpenAI’s embedding models in your Quarkus application, add the `quarkus-langchain4j-openai` extension:

include::./includes/quarkus-langchain4j-maven-dependencies.adoc[provider-artifact=quarkus-langchain4j-openai]

If no other LLM extension is present, xref:ai-services.adoc[AI Services] will automatically use the configured OpenAI embedding model.

== Configuration

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-openai.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

You can configure one or more embedding models, each with its own credentials and model-specific options.

[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
# Default OpenAI model configuration
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.embedding-model.model-name=text-embedding-3-large
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.api-key=sk-...
# Custom OpenAI model configuration
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.some-name.embedding-model.model-name=text-embedding-ada-002
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.some-name.api-key=sk-...
----

== Using Embedding Models

To use the configured embedding models, inject them into your application or RAG components. If you define multiple models, you can select the appropriate one using the `@ModelName` qualifier:

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.ModelName;

@Inject EmbeddingModel defaultEmbeddingModel;
@Inject @ModelName("some-name") EmbeddingModel namedEmbeddingModel;
----

These models are typically used during:

*	Document ingestion, where content is transformed into vector representations
*	Retrieval, where incoming queries are compared against stored vectors for semantic similarity

For a full example, refer to the xref:quickstart-rag.adoc[RAG Getting Started Guide].
