= PGVector Document Store

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]
include::./includes/customization.adoc[]

The PGVector extension allows you to use PostgreSQL as a vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Quarkus LangChain4j.
It leverages the `pgvector` extension in PostgreSQL to store and search vector embeddings efficiently.

== Prerequisites

To use PGVector as a document store:

* A PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension installed is required.
* A Quarkus datasource must be configured.
* The embedding vector dimension must match your embedding model.

[NOTE]
====
PGVector is a native PostgreSQL extension that adds vector similarity search capabilities to PostgreSQL.
It supports L2, cosine, and inner-product distance metrics.
====

NOTE: In dev mode, the `quarkus-langchain4j-pgvector` extension will automatically start a PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension enabled.

== Dependency

To enable PGVector integration in your Quarkus project, add the following Maven dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-langchain4j-pgvector</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

This extension requires a configured Quarkus datasource.
For configuration details, refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/datasource[Quarkus DataSource Guide].

== Embedding Dimension

You must explicitly configure the dimensionality of the embedding vector:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.pgvector.dimension=384
----

This value depends on the embedding model in use:

* `AllMiniLmL6V2QuantizedEmbeddingModel` → 384
* OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` → 1536

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the embedding dimension is missing or mismatched, ingestion and retrieval will fail or produce inaccurate results.

If you switch to a different embedding model, ensure the `dimension` value is updated accordingly.
====

== Usage Example

Once the extension is installed and configured, you can ingest documents into PGVector using the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithPgvector.java[]
----

This example shows how to embed and persist documents using the PGVector store, enabling efficient similarity search during RAG queries.

== Configuration

Customize the behavior of the extension using the following configuration options:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-pgvector.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

== How It Works

The PGVector extension maps each ingested document to a row in a PostgreSQL table* Each row contains:

* The original text content
* Optional metadata
* The vector embedding (stored as a `vector` type column)

During retrieval, a similarity search (e.g., cosine distance) is performed using a `SELECT` query with `ORDER BY embedding <=> :query_vector LIMIT N`.

The extension manages schema creation and indexing automatically unless overridden.

== Summary

To use PostgreSQL and PGVector as a document store with Quarkus LangChain4j:

* Ensure the `pgvector` extension is installed in your PostgreSQL instance.
* Add the extension dependency.
* Configure a datasource and set the correct embedding dimension.
* Use `PgVectorEmbeddingStore` to ingest and retrieve embedded documents.
