= PGVector Document Store

The PGVector extension allows you to use PostgreSQL as a vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Quarkus LangChain4j.
It leverages the `pgvector` extension in PostgreSQL to store and search vector embeddings efficiently.

== Prerequisites

To use PGVector as a document store:

* A PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension installed is required.
* A Quarkus datasource must be configured.
* The embedding vector dimension must match your embedding model.

[NOTE]
====
PGVector is a native PostgreSQL extension that adds vector similarity search capabilities to PostgreSQL.
It supports L2, cosine, and inner-product distance metrics.
====

NOTE: In dev mode, the `quarkus-langchain4j-pgvector` extension will automatically start a PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension enabled.

== Dependency

To enable PGVector integration in your Quarkus project, add the following Maven dependency:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-langchain4j-pgvector</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

This extension requires a configured Quarkus datasource.
For configuration details, refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/datasource[Quarkus DataSource Guide].

== Embedding Dimension

You must explicitly configure the dimensionality of the embedding vector:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.pgvector.dimension=384
----

This value depends on the embedding model in use:

* `AllMiniLmL6V2QuantizedEmbeddingModel` → 384
* OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` → 1536

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the embedding dimension is missing or mismatched, ingestion and retrieval will fail or produce inaccurate results.

If you switch to a different embedding model, ensure the `dimension` value is updated accordingly.
====

== Embedding Index

Use-index controls whether the engine should create and use an index over the embeddings table. 
To create an index, you need the index-list-size parameter, which is a fine-tuning parameter.
This basically creates an IVFFlat index with clusters to extend the effectivness of nearest neighbor search.
If you set the use-index=true you will have to also se the index-list-size=10.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.pgvector.use-index=true
quarkus.langchain4j.pgvector.index-list-size=10
----

Higher index size values speed up queries by reducing the search space during query time.
However, it also decreases the region size, which can lead to more recall errors by excluding some points.
Additionally, more distance comparisons are required to find the closest cluster during step one of the query process.

Here are some recommendations for setting the lists parameter:

* For datasets with less than one million rows, use lists = rows / 1000.
* For datasets with more than one million rows, use lists = sqrt(rows).
* It is generally advisable to have at least 10 clusters.


== Usage Example

Once the extension is installed and configured, you can ingest documents into PGVector using the following code:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithPgvector.java[]
----

This example shows how to embed and persist documents using the PGVector store, enabling efficient similarity search during RAG queries.

== Configuration

Customize the behavior of the extension using the following configuration options:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-pgvector.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

== How It Works

The PGVector extension maps each ingested document to a row in a PostgreSQL table* Each row contains:

* The original text content
* Optional metadata
* The vector embedding (stored as a `vector` type column)

During retrieval, a similarity search (e.g., cosine distance) is performed using a `SELECT` query with `ORDER BY embedding <=> :query_vector LIMIT N`.

The extension manages schema creation and indexing automatically unless overridden.

== Summary

To use PostgreSQL and PGVector as a document store with Quarkus LangChain4j:

* Ensure the `pgvector` extension is installed in your PostgreSQL instance.
* Add the extension dependency.
* Configure a datasource and set the correct embedding dimension.
* Use `PgVectorEmbeddingStore` to ingest and retrieve embedded documents.
