= Function Calling

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]
include::./includes/customization.adoc[]

== Overview

Function calling enables a language model to interact with application-defined tools (methods or functions) as part of generating a response.
This approach enhances the model's capabilities by allowing it to execute actions, fetch data, or perform computations mid-conversation before formulating a final reply.

The Quarkus LangChain4j extension abstracts the complexities of this process, automatically generating the required system prompts, managing tool descriptions, invoking tools, and handling their results.

Function calling requires a model that supports tool use and reasoning (see xref:models.adoc#_reasoning_models[Reasoning Models]).

== Concepts

=== Tools

A tool is a method exposed to the language model.
Tools must be part of a CDI bean and annotated with `@Tool`.
The annotation's description helps the model understand when and how to use it.
When omitted, the name of the method and the name of the parameters is used by the model to understand what the method is about.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class Calculator {

    @Tool("Calculates the length of a string")
    int stringLength(String s) {
        return s.length();
    }
}
----

You can expose multiple tool methods from a single CDI bean, but their method names must be unique across all tools.

TIP: Tool method parameters must follow the snake_case naming convention to ensure compatibility with the LLM.

=== ToolBox - Declaring Tools in AI Services

You declare which tools are available to an AI service using the `@ToolBox` annotation.

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService
interface Assistant {

    @ToolBox(Calculator.class) // <1>
    String chat(String userMessage);
}
----

<1> Provide access to the `stringLength` method from the `Calculator` bean.

Alternatively, you can use `@RegisterAiService(tools=...)` to provide tools to all the methods from the AI service.
Here's a simple example:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService(tools = Calculator.class) // <1>
interface Assistant {
    String chat(String userMessage);
}
----

<1> Provide access to the `stringLength` method from the `Calculator` bean.

== Examples

With Quarkus LangChain4j, function calling provides flexibility, like accessing a database, calling a remote service or invoking another AI service.
This section provides examples for these use cases.

=== Accessing a database

In a Panache repository (or any other database access mechanism you use), you can use the `@Tool` annotation to provide access to your database:


[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class BookingRepository implements PanacheRepository {

    @Tool("Cancel a booking")
    @Transactional
    public void cancelBooking(long bookingId,
      String customerFirstName,
      String customerLastName) {
        var booking = getBookingDetails(bookingId, customerFirstName,customerLastName);
        delete(booking);
    }

    @Tool("List booking for a customer")
    public List listBookingsForCustomer(String customerName,
      String customerSurname) {
        var found = Customer.find("firstName = ?1 and lastName = ?2",
        customerName, customerSurname).singleResultOptional();
        return list("customer", found.get());
    }
}
----

Then, an AI service can be granted access to these methods as follows:

[source, java]
----

public interface MainAiService {

    @ToolBox(BookingRepository.class)
    String answer(String question);

}
----

== Calling a remote service

In Quarkus, you can use a REST Client to represent and invoke a remote service.
Rest Clients follow the same approach as AI services in the sense they use an ambassador pattern.

Thus, you can annotate methods from the Rest Client interface with `@Tool` to allow an AI service to call the remote service:

[source, java]
----
@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "openmeteo")
@Path("/v1")
public interface WeatherForecastService {

    @GET
    @Path("/forecast")
    @ClientQueryParam(name = "forecast_days", value = "7")
    @Tool("Forecasts the weather for the given latitude and longitude")
    WeatherForecast forecast(
            @RestQuery double latitude,
            @RestQuery double longitude);
}
----

Then, an AI service configured with `@ToolBox(WeatherForecastService.class)` can invoke the remote service.

=== Calling another AI service

By adding `@Tool` on an AI service method, another AI service can invoke it:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService
public interface CityExtractorAgent {

    @UserMessage("""
    You are given one question and you have to extract
    city name from it. Only reply the city name if it
    exists or reply 'unknown_city' if there is no city
    name in question

   Here is the question: {question}
   """)

    @Tool("Extracts the city from a question")
    String extractCity(String question);
}
----

[source, java]
----
@RegisterAiService
public interface MainAiService {

    @ToolBox(CityExtractorAgent.class)
    String answer(String question);

}
----

== Recommendations for Function Calling

When utilizing function calling, consider:

- Setting the model temperature to 0 for the AI service to consistently choose the most probable action.
- Ensuring well-detailed descriptions of tools.
- Listing steps in the prompt in the desired execution order.

== Execution Models

The tool execution model determines how the tool is invoked:

* `@Blocking`: runs on the caller thread
* `@NonBlocking`: runs on an _event loop_ and *must* not block
* `@RunOnVirtualThread`: runs on a virtual thread

If the return type is a `Uni` or a `CompletionStage`, it is treated as non-blocking

.Blocking example
[source,java]
----
@Tool("get the customer name for the given customerId")
public String getCustomerName(long id) {
    return find("id", id).firstResult().name;
}
----

.Non-Blocking example
[source,java]
----
@Tool("add a and b")
@NonBlocking
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
----

.Virtual thread example
[source,java]
----
@Tool("get the customer name for the given customerId")
@RunOnVirtualThread
public String getCustomerName(long id) {
    return find("id", id).firstResult().name;
}
----

More details on virtual thread support in Quarkus can be found in the https://quarkus.io/guides/virtual-threads[Virtual Thread reference guide].


=== Streaming Support

When AI service methods return streams (`Multi<String>`), the model emits each token on the event loop.

Blocking tools cannot run on the event loop.
Thus, Quarkus LangChain4j automatically shifts to a worker thread or virtual thread when required.

[source,java]
----
@UserMessage("...")
@ToolBox({TransactionRepository.class, CustomerRepository.class}) // <1>
Multi<Fraud> detectAmountFraudForCustomerStreamed(long customerId);
----

<1> The invocation to the repositories are automatically dispatched to a worker thread as the defined tool methods are blocking.

== Request Scope Propagation

When the request scope is active, tool invocations can inherit it, enabling propagation of transactional or security contexts.
This applies even when running on virtual threads or worker threads.

== Dynamically Providing Tools

Instead of declaring tools statically, you can provide them dynamically using `ToolProvider`.

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService(toolProviderSupplier = MyToolProviderSupplier.class)
public interface MyAiService {
// ...
}
----


To support dynamic tool selection, you'll need to create a `ToolProviderSupplier`, which must be marked as `@ApplicationScoped`.
Here's an example:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyToolProviderSupplier implements Supplier<ToolProvider> {
    @Inject MyCustomToolProvider provider;

    public ToolProvider get() {
        return provider;
    }
}
----

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCustomToolProvider implements ToolProvider {
    @Inject BookingTool bookingTool;

    public ToolProviderResult provideTools(ToolProviderRequest request) {
        boolean containsBooking = request.userMessage().singleText().contains("booking");
        if (!containsBooking) {
            return ToolProviderResult.builder().build(); // No tools
        }
        return buildToolProviderResult(List.of(bookingTool)); // Only the booking tool will be provided in this case
    }
}
----

=== Alternative: Using `ToolSpecification` and `ToolExecutor`

If you prefer more control, you can work directly with `ToolSpecification` and `ToolExecutor` to provide tools.


== How Function Calling Works Internally

First, it's important to understand that the model never calls the _tools_ directly, **but** always goes through the AI-infused application.

image::function-calling-seq.png["How functions are called by a model",width=600]

Here is the process explained:

1. The user's input is combined with tool descriptions.
2. The LLM is prompted with that context.
3. The LLM responds with a function_call (tool name + parameters).
4. The Quarkus Langchain4J extension invokes the tool and returns the result to the LLM.
5. The LLM may continue reasoning or produce a final answer.

These interactions are stored in the memory (see xref:messages-and-memory.adoc[Messages and Memory]) to maintain context across reasoning steps.

== Example: Multi-step Tool Reasoning

This section provides a slightly more complicated example with an AI Service using multiple tools:

- A tool to extract a city from a question (implemented as another AI service)
- A tool to access weather data (implemented as a REST client)
- A tool to transform a location into latitude and longitude (implemented as a REST client)

image::agent.png["Agent orchestrating tool usage",width=600]

The main AI service is the following:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService(modelName = "tool-use")
public interface WeatherForecastAgent {

    @SystemMessage("""
        You are a meteorologist, and you need to answer questions asked by the user about weather using at most 3 lines.

        The weather information is a JSON object and has the following fields:

        maxTemperature is the maximum temperature of the day in Celsius degrees
        minTemperature is the minimum temperature of the day in Celsius degrees
        precipitation is the amount of water in mm
        windSpeed is the speed of wind in kilometers per hour
        weather is the overall weather.
    """)
    @ToolBox({CityExtractorAgent.class, WeatherForecastService.class, GeoCodingService.class}) // <1>
    String chat(String query);
}
----

<1> List of the three tools to answer the user question like: "What's the weather tomorrow in Valence."

The previous AI service is the one that will reason about the user question and orchestrate the calls to the different tools to produce the final response.

The tool _implementations_ are very simple:

1) The city extractor agent just extracts the city from the user question. It's implemented as an AI service.
[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@RegisterAiService(chatMemoryProviderSupplier = RegisterAiService.NoChatMemoryProviderSupplier.class) // <1>
public interface CityExtractorAgent {

    @UserMessage("""
        You are given one question and you have to extract city name from it
        Only reply the city name if it exists or reply 'unknown_city' if there is no city name in question

        Here is the question: {question}
        """)
    @Tool("Extracts the city from a question") // <2>
    String extractCity(String question); // <3>
}
----

<1> This service does not require memory.
<2> The tool description, the LLM can use it to decide when to call this tool.
<3> The method signature, the LLM use it to know how to call this tool.

2) The geocoding tool is a REST client that provide the _GeoResult_ for a given city:

[source, java]
----
@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "geocoding")
@Path("/v1")
public interface GeoCodingService {

    @GET
    @Path("/search")
    @ClientQueryParam(name = "count", value = "1") // Limit the number of results to 1 (HTTP query parameter)
    @Tool("Finds the latitude and longitude of a given city")
    GeoResults findCity(@RestQuery String name);
}
----

3) The weather forecast tools is also implemented as a REST client:

[source, java]
----
@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "openmeteo")
@Path("/v1")
public interface WeatherForecastService {

    @GET
    @Path("/forecast")
    @ClientQueryParam(name = "forecast_days", value = "7")
    @ClientQueryParam(name = "daily", value = {
            "temperature_2m_max",
            "temperature_2m_min",
            "precipitation_sum",
            "wind_speed_10m_max",
            "weather_code"
    })
    @Tool("Forecasts the weather for the given latitude and longitude")
    WeatherForecast forecast(@RestQuery double latitude, @RestQuery double longitude);
}
----

== Summary

Function calling enables the model to take actions and retrieve external information by invoking application-defined tools. Quarkus LangChain4j simplifies this process through annotations and automatic orchestration and execution.
