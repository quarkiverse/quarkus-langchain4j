= Milvus Embedding Store

Milvus is a scalable and high-performance vector database optimized for AI and semantic search use cases.
This guide explains how to use Milvus as an embedding store in Quarkus LangChain4j for RAG applications.

== Overview

The `quarkus-langchain4j-milvus` extension enables seamless integration with a Milvus instance for storing and retrieving embedded documents using vector similarity.

Milvus supports approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search with various indexing strategies and similarity metrics.

== Dependency

To enable Milvus integration in your Quarkus project, add the following dependency:

include::./includes/quarkus-langchain4j-maven-dependencies.adoc[provider-artifact=quarkus-langchain4j-milvus]

== Dev Services Support

This extension includes Dev Services support. In dev and test mode, a containerized Milvus instance is started automatically.

To configure Dev Services for Milvus, set the vector dimension according to your embedding model:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.milvus.dimension=384
----

TIP: For example, `AllMiniLmL6V2QuantizedEmbeddingModel` → 384; OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` → 1536.

== Connecting to an External Milvus Instance

If you prefer to connect to a remote Milvus instance, disable Dev Services and provide the host and port:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.milvus.host=localhost
quarkus.langchain4j.milvus.port=19530
quarkus.langchain4j.milvus.dimension=384
----

When a host is defined, Dev Services will not start a container.

== Usage Example

Once the extension is configured, you can use Milvus as an embedding store in your ingestion logic:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/IngestorExampleWithMilvus.java[]
----

This example shows how to store vectorized content and make it retrievable via similarity search.

== Configuration Options

Customize the behavior of the extension using the following configuration options:

include::includes/quarkus-langchain4j-milvus.adoc[leveloffset=+1,opts=optional]

== How It Works

Milvus stores each embedded text segment along with its metadata and vector in a collection. The vector similarity search uses one of several distance metrics:

* `COSINE`
* `L2` (Euclidean)
* `IP` (Inner Product / dot product)

The extension automatically initializes the collection and schema if it does not already exist. It uses gRPC-based access for high performance and low latency.

== Summary

To use Milvus with Quarkus LangChain4j:

1. Add the required extension
2. Set the embedding dimension to match your model
3. Use Dev Services or connect to an external Milvus instance
4. Ingest documents and perform similarity search using `MilvusEmbeddingStore`
