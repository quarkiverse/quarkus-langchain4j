AI-infused applications rely on specialized models, each fulfilling a specific role in the application's workflow.
Quarkus LangChain4j provides a consistent and intuitive programming model across different AI capabilities, enabling developers to focus on business logic rather than low-level integration.

This page introduces the types of models supported by Quarkus LangChain4j, their typical use cases, and the core entities they manipulate.

For supported model providers, refer to the navigation menu.

== What Is a Model?

A model is a trained neural network capable of performing a specific task such as text generation, classification, moderation, or image creation. They are often based on architectures like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)[Transformers], which excel at processing sequential data.

Depending on the task, we distinguish between:

* _Generative models_, which produce new content (e.g., text, images)
* _Predictive models_, which infer properties or classifications from the input

These models learn patterns from large training datasets. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the expected outcomes.
This process enables the model to #statistically deduce the most probable output based on a given input#, a process rooted in probability distributions over _tokens_ or input features.

The outcome of training is a mathematical function that maps input to output: a model that can now be _served_ to clients.
#Model serving refers to the process of making a trained model accessible via an interface# (e.g., HTTP API, gRPC, SDK) so that applications can send inputs and receive predictions or generations at runtime.

Models in Quarkus LangChain4j are consumed through abstraction layers that unify interaction across providers and runtime environments.

The following table outlines common model types and the entities they manipulate:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Model Type |Entities Manipulated

|Chat & Streaming Models | Chat messages (role-based history, plain text, optional function calls)
|Embedding Models | Text or image inputs → numerical vector representations (embeddings)
|Moderation Models | Text or image inputs → moderation results (categories, scores, flags)
|Image Models | Text prompts → images (URLs, streams, or base64)
|Reasoning Models | Structured inputs/outputs (e.g. tool calls, JSON structures, action plans)
|===

== Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose models trained on massive text corpora.
They can perform a wide range of natural language tasks:

* Text generation
* Question answering
* Summarization
* Classification
* Translation

Quarkus LangChain4j integrates LLMs through providers like OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ollama, and JLama.

== Chat Models

Chat models are conversational LLMs optimized for #multi-turn dialogue#.
They maintain context across exchanges (memory), handle roles (user, assistant, system), and support structured interactions like tool calling or function invocation.

Chat models operate on sequences of #messages#, each consisting of:

* a `role` — one of `user`, `assistant`, `system`, or `function`
* a `content` — typically plain text (though structured formats like JSON or Markdown may also be used)
* optional metadata — such as `name`, `tool_calls`, or function outputs

This design allows applications to guide and constrain model behavior:
- `system` messages set the context or persona
- `user` messages provide prompts or queries
- `assistant` messages are model-generated responses
- `function` messages are returned after invoking external tools

== Streaming Models

Streaming models are a variant of chat models that output incrementally produce token by token.
They are ideal for responsive user interfaces, allowing partial content (e.g., a sentence in progress) to be displayed immediately.

In Quarkus LangChain4j, streaming responses are exposed as `Multi<String>` sequences.

[#_embedding_models]== Embedding Models

Embedding models convert #unstructured input (text or images) into numerical vectors known as _embeddings_#.
An embedding is a high-dimensional representation that captures semantic similarity: items with similar meaning are close together in vector space.

These embeddings are useful for:

* Similarity search
* Clustering and classification
* Document retrieval (RAG)
* Recommender systems

The input entity is typically a `String` or image, and the output is a `float[]` embedding vector.

== Moderation Models

Moderation models analyze content and flag potentially harmful, offensive, or policy-violating material.

== Image Models

Image models generate or manipulate images using text prompts.
They may support tasks such as:

* Text-to-image generation
* Inpainting or editing
* Image variation or transformation

The output is generally an image URL, byte stream, or base64-encoded representation.

[#_reasoning_models]== Reasoning Models

Reasoning models go beyond plain generation by supporting structured planning, problem-solving, and tool invocation. They are commonly used when the model needs to make decisions, call external tools, or follow multi-step workflows.
They are the base for building complex AI agents that can reason about tasks, invoke APIs, and produce structured outputs, paving the way for #agentic architectures#.

Reasoning capabilities are especially useful in:

* Agents that dynamically choose tools to use
* Function-calling scenarios with parameter extraction
* Multi-step question answering or decision trees

Reasoning models may produce structured responses such as:

* JSON payloads representing tool invocations
* Structured plans or action sequences
* Multiple steps of intermediate reasoning

Several techniques can be employed during inference to enhance reasoning quality:

* _Chain of Thought (CoT)_ — the model is prompted to explicitly enumerate intermediate steps before reaching a conclusion. This improves transparency and success rate on complex problems.
* _Backtracking_ — the model explores alternative paths or corrects prior steps based on later inconsistencies (especially useful in code generation or symbolic reasoning).
* _Self-Consistency_ — instead of relying on a single answer, the model produces multiple reasoning paths and aggregates them to derive a consensus.
* _Function-calling_ or _tool use_ — the model delegates parts of the solution to external systems, such as APIs or computation libraries.

=== Performance Tradeoff

Reasoning models often exhibit a tradeoff between training complexity and inference efficiency:

* Training-time investment: Techniques like instruction tuning or tool-aware pretraining can embed reasoning patterns into the model, improving reliability at inference time.
* Inference-time complexity: More advanced reasoning (e.g., multi-step plans, CoT) may increase latency and token consumption, especially when iterative self-reflection is involved.

== Orchestration Through AI Services

Quarkus LangChain4j enables orchestration across multiple model types using `@RegisterAiService`.
