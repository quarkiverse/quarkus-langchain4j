= Podman AI Lab Chat Models

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]
include::./includes/customization.adoc[]

https://developers.redhat.com/products/podman-desktop/podman-ai-lab/[Podman AI Lab] is a local AI development environment provided as an extension to Podman Desktop.
It simplifies experimentation with AI by providing a curated catalog of models and recipes, all runnable on your local machine via containerized infrastructure.

Podman AI Lab includes an inference server that is **compatible with the OpenAI REST API**, making it usable with the `quarkus-langchain4j-openai` extension.

== Prerequisites

To use Podman AI Lab with Quarkus:

1. Install https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation[Podman Desktop].
2. From the Podman Desktop UI, install the **Podman AI Lab** extension from the *Extensions* catalog.
See https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-ai-lab?tab=readme-ov-file#installation[this guide] for step-by-step instructions.
3. Launch Podman AI Lab and download a model (such as `granite-7b`) through the UI.
4. Start the inference server by selecting the model and clicking *Run*.

== Dependency

Add the OpenAI extension to your project:

include::./includes/quarkus-langchain4j-maven-dependencies.adoc[provider-artifact=quarkus-langchain4j-openai]

Even though this is not an actual OpenAI deployment, the API is compatible and works seamlessly with this extension.

IMPORTANT: Only the chat model API is supported at the moment. Other OpenAI APIs (like embeddings or moderation) are not available through Podman AI Lab.

== Configuration

Once the inference server is running (e.g., on port `44079`), configure your application like so:

[source,properties,subs=attributes+]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.base-url=http://localhost:44079/v1
# Responses may be slightly slower than cloud models
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.timeout=60s
----

[TIP]
====
You can verify the port from the Podman AI Lab UI under the *Running Inference Server* section.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Podman AI Lab currently supports **only a single running model** at a time.
This means that any `model-name` configuration is ignored.
The model to use must be selected manually through the Podman AI Lab UI.
====

== Usage

Once configured, you can use the API as if communicating with an OpenAI model:

[source,java]
----
@Inject ChatModel chatModel;
----

Or register an AI service interface:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService
public interface Assistant {
    String chat(String prompt);
}
----

== Limitations

- Only **chat models** are supported at the moment.
- Embedding and moderation APIs are **not yet available**.
- The inference server only runs **one model at a time**.
- GPU support is not currently enabled; all inference runs on CPU.
