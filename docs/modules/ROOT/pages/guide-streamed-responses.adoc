= Using Streamed Responses with Quarkus LangChain4j

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]
include::./includes/customization.adoc[]

Streamed responses allow large language models to return partial answers as they are generated.
It significantly improves latency and responsiveness for end users.
With Quarkus LangChain4j, you can integrate streaming via REST (SSE) or WebSockets, leveraging `Multi<String>` for reactive, non-blocking processing.

This guide shows how to:

* Define AI services that return streamed responses
* Implement both SSE and WebSocket endpoints
* Test your application using `curl` and `wscat`

== Why Use Streamed Responses?

Traditional AI services generate the entire response before returning it, which can lead to:

* Perceived latency (long pause before the first word appears)
* Higher memory usage (especially for long completions)

Streaming addresses this by sending tokens as they are produced. Benefits include:

* Better user experience (progressive rendering)
* Reduced memory pressure on both server and client
* Easier integration with frontend frameworks (chat bots, dashboards)

== Project Setup

Add the following dependencies in your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<!-- Or any other model provider that supports streaming, such as OpenAI -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-langchain4j-ollama</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-rest-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-websockets-next</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

IF you are using Ollama, configure your model in `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.ollama.chat-model.model-name=qwen3:1.7b
----

== Streamed Responses in AI Services

To enable streaming, your AI service method must return a `Multi<String>`.
Each emitted item represents a token or part of the final response.

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService
@SystemMessage("You are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise and to the point.")
public interface StreamedAssistant {

    @UserMessage("Answer the question: {question}")
    Multi<String> respondToQuestion(String question);

}
----

Quarkus uses https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/latest/[Mutiny] under the hood.
In Quarkus, methods returning Multi are considered non-blocking.
Do not use blocking code inside streaming pipelines. For details, refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/quarkus-reactive-architecture[Quarkus Reactive Architecture].

== Streaming with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE is a simple way to stream text over HTTP. Let’s expose an endpoint returning `Multi<String>` as an event stream:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/stream")
public class Endpoint {

    @Inject StreamedAssistant assistant;

    @POST
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
    public Multi<String> stream(String question) {
        return assistant.respondToQuestion(question);
    }
}
----

Run the application (`mvn quarkus:dev`), then use `curl`:

[source,bash]
----
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8080/stream -d "Why is the sky blue?" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
----

The `-N` option disables buffering so you see the stream as it arrives.
You’ll receive a stream of tokens, each appearing as a new line in the terminal.

== Streaming with WebSockets

For more interactive use cases (chat UIs, dashboards), you can expose a WebSocket endpoint using Quarkus WebSockets.Next.

[source,java]
----
@WebSocket(path = "/ws/stream")
public class WebSocketEndpoint {

    @Inject WSStreamedAssistant assistant;

    @OnTextMessage
    public Multi<String> onTextMessage(String question) {
        return assistant.respondToQuestion(question);
    }
}
----

To manage state across messages (local message history), annotate the AI service with `@SessionScoped`:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterAiService
@SystemMessage("You are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise and to the point.")
@SessionScoped
public interface WSStreamedAssistant {

    @UserMessage("Answer the question: {question}")
    Multi<String> respondToQuestion(String question);
}
----

Install a WebSocket client like `wscat`:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g wscat
----

Connect and send a message:

[source,bash]
----
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/ws/stream
> Why is swimming pool water blue?
----

You’ll see a token stream printed as separate lines in real-time.

== Summary

* Use `Multi<String>` in your AI services to enable streaming
* Streaming improves user experience and scalability
* SSE offers a simple HTTP-based solution
* WebSockets provide a more interactive and stateful option
