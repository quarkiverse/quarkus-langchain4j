/**
 * An annotation to apply guardrails to the input of the model.

 * Guardrails can only be used with AI Services.
 * <p>
 * An input guardrail is a rule that is applied to the input of the model (basically the user message) to ensure that
 * the input is safe and meets the expectations of the model.
 * It does not replace moderation model, but it can be used to add additional checks.
 * <p>
 * Unlike for output guardrails, the input guardrails do not support retry or reprompt.
 * The failure is passed directly to the caller, wrapped into a {@link GuardrailException}
 * <p>
 * If the annotation is present on a class, the guardrails will be applied to all the methods of the class.
 * <p>
 * When several guardrails are applied, the order of the guardrails is important, as the guardrails are applied in the
 * order they are listed.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link dev.langchain4j.service.guardrail.InputGuardrails} instead
