/**
 * An annotation to apply guardrails to the output of the model.
 * <p>
 * Guardrails can only be used with AI Services and only on method that do not stream the response.
 * <p>
 * A guardrail is a rule that is applied to the output of the model to ensure that the output is safe and meets the
 * expectations.
 * When a validation fails, the result can indicate whether the request should be retried and provide a {@code reprompt}
 * message.
 * <p>
 * In the case of reprompting, the reprompt message is added to the LLM context and the request is retried.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the annotation is present on a class, the guardrails will be applied to all the methods of the class.
 * <p>
 * When several guardrails are applied, the order of the guardrails is important. Note that in case of retry or reprompt,
 * all the guardrails will be re-applied to the new response.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link dev.langchain4j.service.guardrail.OutputGuardrails} instead
